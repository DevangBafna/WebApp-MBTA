# **Project Overview [~1 paragraph]**
*<div style="text-align: justify">The MBTA Helper shows the closest MBTA Station and whether it is wheelchair accessible to the street you want in Massachusetts. For this assignment, we assume that the user knows the street name of their current/target location. First of all, using the MapQuest API, we detected the latitude and longitude of the street that the user wanted to find the closest MBTA Station. Then by using MBTA V3 API Portal, we found the nearest MBTA station through the coordinates we detected in the first step. Surprisingly, we did not need to use our API Key for this process. It was working perfectly fine with the sort, latitude, and longitude filter. In the third and final step, we showed the name and the wheelchair accessibility of the nearest MBTA station. Downtown Boston has a very dense population and many close MBTA Stations so our MBTA Helper’s results may vary from other MBTA Helper projects. So from the user’s point of view, they would input a street name (preferably with the unit as well, for example: 131 Clarendon St) and the respective city and click Submit. Then the web app would show the results and in case there is an error, it shows an error message with a link to the form for a resubmission. An interesting thing about the MapQuest API is that if the street name is a number, it will still give results because of street names that start with a number.</div>*

# **Project Reflection [~2 paragraphs]**
*<div style="text-align: justify">Assignment 3 was one of the most challenging and fun assignments we had during this class. The hardest thing about this assignment was combining almost everything we learned this semester. One of the best things about the assignment was that although we knew that one would use this product, we were able to create a valuable product for society. This assignment showed an example of problem-solving and software design. After completing the assignment, we got a better understanding of the final project and we are looking forward to working on our final project. MapQuest API works with the street names only like 133 Seaport Blvd, so we wished we had the Google Map API to find the nearest MBTA Stations for place names like Boston Common. Lastly, we believed that we could have made our web app more visually appealing; however, for now, our knowledge of HTML is minimal. We will do some self-learning and have a more visually appealing product for the final project.</div>*

*<div style="text-align: justify">We had both synchronous and asynchronous work for the assignment. However, we think that we spent less time on this assignment compared to the other two assignments we had. We had one in-person and two online meetings for the assignment. In these meetings, we would split the workload evenly. For instance, we would code together by sharing screens on webex. We had great conversations before and after working on the project. We believe that we had a good balance of work and fun. We listened to Hey Jude while working on the project, and the best part is we introduced our debugging ducks to each other. We are looking forward to working together on the final project.</div>*
